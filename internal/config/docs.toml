# As a best practice, take regular database backups in case of accidental data loss. This best practice is especially important when you upgrade your Chainlink node to a new version. Chainlink nodes support automated database backups to make this process easier.

#
# Ideally, you should use a container orchestration system like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to ensure that only one Chainlink node instance can ever use a specific Postgres database. However, some node operators do not have the technical capacity to do this. Common use cases run multiple Chainlink node instances in failover mode as recommended by our official documentation. The first instance takes a lock on the database and subsequent instances will wait trying to take this lock in case the first instance fails.
#
# By default, Chainlink nodes use the `dual` setting to provide both advisory locks and lease locks for backward and forward compatibility. Using advisory locks alone presents the following problems:
#
# - If your nodes or applications hold locks open for several hours or days, Postgres is unable to complete internal cleanup tasks. The Postgres maintainers explicitly discourage holding locks open for long periods of time.
# - Advisory locks can silently disappear when you upgrade Postgres, so a new Chainlink node instance can take over even while the old node is still running.
# - Advisory locks do not work well with pooling tools such as [pgbouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/).
# - If the Chainlink node crashes, an advisory lock can hang around for up to several hours, which might require you to manually remove it so another instance of the Chainlink node will allow itself to boot.
#
# Because of the complications with advisory locks, Chainlink nodes with v1.1.0 and later support a new `lease` locking mode. This mode might become the default in future. The `lease` locking mode works using the following process:
#
# - Node A creates one row in the database with the client ID and updates it once per second.
# - Node B spinlocks and checks periodically to see if the client ID is too old. If the client ID is not updated after a period of time, node B assumes that node A failed and takes over. Node B becomes the owner of the row and updates the client ID once per second.
# - If node A comes back, it attempts to take out a lease, realizes that the database has been leased to another process, and exits the entire application immediately.

# Forces EIP-1559 transaction mode for all chains. Enabling EIP-1559 mode can help reduce gas costs on chains that support it. This is supported only on official Ethereum mainnet and testnets. It is not recommended to enable this setting on Polygon because the EIP-1559 fee market appears to be broken on all Polygon chains and EIP-1559 transactions are less likely to be included than legacy transactions.
#
# #### Technical details
#
# Chainlink nodes include experimental support for submitting transactions using type 0x2 (EIP-1559) envelope.
#
# EIP-1559 mode is enabled by default on the Ethereum Mainnet, but can be enabled on a per-chain basis or globally.
#
# This might help to save gas on spikes. Chainlink nodes should react faster on the upleg and avoid overpaying on the downleg. It might also be possible to set `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_BATCH_SIZE` to a smaller value such as 12 or even 6 because tip cap should be a more consistent indicator of inclusion time than total gas price. This would make Chainlink nodes more responsive and should reduce response time variance. Some experimentation is required to find optimum settings.
#
# Set with caution, if you set this on a chain that does not actually support EIP-1559 your node will be broken.
#
# In EIP-1559 mode, the total price for the transaction is the minimum of base fee + tip cap and fee cap. More information can be found on the [official EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).
#
# Chainlink's implementation of EIP-1559 works as follows:
#
# If you are using FixedPriceEstimator:
# - With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=MaxGasPriceWei` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`
# - With gas bumping enabled, it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=GasFeeCapDefault` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`.
#
# If you are using BlockHistoryEstimator (default for most chains):
# - With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=MaxGasPriceWei` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
# - With gas bumping enabled (default for most chains) it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=current block base fee * (1.125 ^ N)` where N is configurable by setting BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_EIP1559_FEE_CAP_BUFFER_BLOCKS but defaults to `gas bump threshold+1` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
#
# Bumping works as follows:
#
# - Increase tipcap by `max(tipcap * (1 + GasBumpPercent), tipcap + GasBumpWei)`
# - Increase feecap by `max(feecap * (1 + GasBumpPercent), feecap + GasBumpWei)`
#
# A quick note on terminology - Chainlink nodes use the same terms used internally by go-ethereum source code to describe various prices. This is not the same as the externally used terms. For reference:
#
# - Base Fee Per Gas = BaseFeePerGas
# - Max Fee Per Gas = FeeCap
# - Max Priority Fee Per Gas = TipCap
#
# In EIP-1559 mode, the following changes occur to how configuration works:
#
# - All new transactions will be sent as type 0x2 transactions specifying a TipCap and FeeCap. Be aware that existing pending legacy transactions will continue to be gas bumped in legacy mode.
# - `BlockHistoryEstimator` will apply its calculations (gas percentile etc) to the TipCap and this value will be used for new transactions (GasPrice will be ignored)
# - `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasTipCapDefault` instead of `GasPriceDefault` for the tip cap
# - `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasFeeCapDefault` instaed of `GasPriceDefault` for the fee cap
# - `MinGasPriceWei` is ignored for new transactions and `GasTipCapMinimum` is used instead (default 0)
